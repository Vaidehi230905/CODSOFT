calculator.py – A basic calculator for performing arithmetic operations.

pass_generator.py – Generates strong random passwords based on user-defined length.

rock_paper_scissor.py – A Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer with score tracking and an interactive GUI.

contact_book.py – A contact management system to store, search, update, and delete contacts using a user-friendly interface.

These mini-projects demonstrate practical Python usage with clear, interactive interfaces and are great for understanding the fundamentals of application development.
